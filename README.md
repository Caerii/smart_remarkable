# Smart Remarkable

This fork is developing a multi-agent client for Paper Pro and eventually Paper
Pro Move. Start with the [Mac-hosted notebook assistant](docs/LAN_CLIENT.md); the upstream
features and instructions below remain available.

A Vision-LLM agent for the reMarkable tablet. It watches what you write, and
when you trigger it, sends a screenshot to an LLM and draws (or types) the
response back onto the screen.

This project is a fork of [awwaiid/ghostwriter](https://github.com/awwaiid/ghostwriter), extended with Select Mode.

## Current branch: Paper Pro 3.28.0.169

**Functional Pro activation is blocked on server compatibility.** The two-button
patch is locally qualified, but the installed OpenClaw Codex 2026.9.5 runtime
does not invoke the required final authorization hook. Server candidates were
rolled back and the tablet still has its prior disabled Smart icons. Do not
run the promotion command until the missing gate is fixed and both live modes
pass. This section describes the prepared workflow, not a completed installation.
**Paper Pro Move is not supported by this build** and needs its own
capture/input/launcher port; do not install the Pro worker there.

Both lasso actions now share Dispatch's maintained server-side policy: literal
reading before interpretation, clarification instead of consequential guesses,
English/French/Hebrew handling, handwriting enhancement, and the shared
`openai/gpt-6-astra` / `low` defaults. Dispatch and Smart import the same
`remarkable-agent-policy` module rather than maintaining separate copies of
these rules. Their delivery adapters remain separate: Smart retains its own
authenticated request binding, replay protection and safe notebook insertion.
This does not change ordinary WhatsApp model/session defaults.

Once activated, lasso normally, lift the pen, and choose an icon after **Copy**:

| Icon | Action | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sparkling notebook | **Answer here** | Requests a concise plain-text answer, delivers the remote response, and inserts only the answer into the original notebook when safe. |
| Sparkles | **Send to agent** | Uses the same reading and agent policy, delivers the remote response, and never types or draws into the notebook. |

Both use the canonical OpenClaw conversation and server-side history/memory.
The selected region is the primary input; the same-instant page image and
notebook title are supporting context. Both retain the WhatsApp acknowledgement
and final-answer flow plus a response PDF sent to the configured reMarkable
Cloud library; the final status reports a failed PDF upload rather than claiming
delivery. Cloud acceptance is not proof of arrival on a particular tablet.

**Answer here is deliberately conditional:** the original page/view must remain
unchanged, the text tool and caret must be verified, and there must be no physical
interaction during insertion. The current keyboard path accepts only supported
ASCII text within its 2,048-byte / 600-key budget. An unsupported or oversized
answer skips local insertion; it is not truncated or transliterated to force it
onto the page. Unicode answers remain intact in the remote WhatsApp/PDF path.

See the [server policy release record](playbook/log/2026-09-19-dispatch-policy-release.md)
for current deployment evidence and the
[Pro functional promotion plan](playbook/log/2026-09-19-smart-functional-plan.md)
for the exact installation and rollback procedure. Older deployment histories
below describe prior firmware and must not be replayed as the current recipe.

## Paper Pro 3.28 / OpenClaw workflow

This branch keeps the stock notebook UI running and prints each response as
ordinary editable reMarkable text. It provides one **Smart Remarkable**
AppLoad tile and exactly three configurable modes:

| Mode | What submits | Lifetime |
|---|---|---|
| `once` | Complete a native lasso and lift the pen. | Exits after the first valid selection; default limit 10 minutes. |
| `session-hold` | Complete a native lasso, pause at the closing point with the pen still touching, then lift after the hold. | Handles multiple requests; default limit 60 minutes. This is the default and the safest button-free session mode. |
| `session-auto` | Every completed native lasso submits when the pen lifts. | Handles multiple requests; default limit 60 minutes. Opt in carefully because an ordinary selection edit can also be sent. |

The AppLoad tile toggles the configured worker on and off. To start a session,
open **My files → left sidebar → AppLoad**, tap **Smart Remarkable**, return
to the notebook, and use the interaction for the configured mode. Tap the
same AppLoad tile again to stop early; otherwise PID 1 stops the worker at its
time limit or whenever stock `xochitl` stops.

### Exact `session-hold` gesture

The hold happens *before* pen-up, at the point where the lasso loop closes:

1. Select reMarkable's native lasso tool.
2. Put the pen down, draw a loop around the handwriting, and return to the
   starting point without lifting.
3. With the loop closed, keep the tip touching the screen and keep the
   endpoint nearly still for at least 800 ms. The default tolerance is 12
   normalized screen pixels; moving farther resets the hold timer.
4. Lift the pen only after that pause. Smart then waits for the stock
   selection marquee, submits only the selected crop, and types the response
   below it.

Lifting immediately still creates an ordinary reMarkable selection but does
not submit it in `session-hold`. A pen tap or a too-small path is ignored. A
contact that began while another answer was processing is also ignored
rather than queued; draw a fresh lasso after the answer finishes.

### Native answer-here and agent buttons

The preferred explicit interaction, once the firmware-specific two-button
patch has passed its device canary, is:

1. Use the native lasso normally and lift the pen.
2. Immediately after the stock **Copy** action, choose:
   - The **sparkling notebook** to send the selection to canonical OpenClaw,
     receive the working acknowledgement and final in WhatsApp, and insert
     that exact final as editable stock text below the selection.
   - The **sparkles** to send the same canonical OpenClaw turn and receive the
     same WhatsApp acknowledgement/final sequence, with no tablet text, pen,
     or touch output.
3. The chosen button highlights at once and shared pending state ignores
   repeated taps. The `0.8.0-openclaw` v3 QML records the live `ink`, `image`,
   or `mixed` kind, fixed-point selection rectangle, stable
   `normal`/`rot180` orientation, exact document UUID, page id/index, mapped
   current-page bounds and completeness, and capture time. `DeviceSceneView`
   supplies that document/page identity explicitly; the selection handler does
   not guess it by walking its parent tree. When the stock menu appears, QML
   defers creation of one
   parent-owned `AppLoadLibrary` helper and caches it for that selection handler.
   A tap then yields one event-loop turn so the selected state can paint,
   revalidates the exact pending snapshot, and reuses that helper for AppLoad's
   non-QTFB `launchExternal`. A positive launcher PID is required; an exception
   or non-positive result clears pending state. This direct call avoids
   AppLoad's global launcher broadcast and its no-GUI window path, while caching
   removes repeated dynamic QML compilation from the tap and acknowledgement
   paths. AppLoad strictly parses the descriptor, starts the local worker when
   necessary, derives a fresh 256-bit nonce with the firmware-proven
   `/usr/bin/hexdump` interface, validates exactly 64 lowercase hexadecimal
   characters, and publishes a root-only busy marker before the trigger. Local
   capture readiness does not wait for the SSH tunnel or bridge.
4. Smart asks QML to re-read the same selection and document/page identity
   immediately before capture. Only an exact match temporarily hides the stock
   tint, border, and menu via the stock `controlsAreVisible` flag and returns a
   nonce-bound prepare acknowledgement. One immutable framebuffer read then
   produces both the descriptor crop and the faithful current-page view from
   that same instant. Handwriting in the focal crop keeps the established
   whitening and enlargement; image and mixed crops preserve RGB and tonal
   detail, while the supporting page view is never whitened. Smart also
   resolves the notebook's visible filename from the exact document UUID by a
   bounded, no-follow, stable metadata read. If the mapped page is not fully
   visible, metadata says `viewport_only`; Smart never zooms or navigates to
   manufacture a logical full-page image.
5. After both images and the bounded metadata exist only in memory, Smart asks
   QML to revalidate
   once more, calls reMarkable's own selection-close path, and requires the
   matching close acknowledgement before any remote submission. A pre-close
   capture or validation failure restores the stock controls and leaves the
   selection recoverable. This does not copy, delete, move, or change the
   selected content. No pen hold or four-finger gesture is involved.
6. The private tunnel starts in parallel and publishes separate remote
   readiness. OpenClaw/WhatsApp work continues after the local marquee closes,
   while the busy generation rejects later taps instead of queueing them. The
   strict `selection-page-v1` request sends one text part followed by the focal
   selection and same-instant page images with fixed roles, plus the document
   display name and page metadata. OpenClaw treats the lasso as the user's
   primary input and the page/title as untrusted supporting context. For
   answer-here, Smart retains the complete normalized page captured while the
   exact selection was still prepared, then requires the first post-close frame
   to match those original bytes. A missing or changed original-page binding
   preserves the canonical OpenClaw/WhatsApp result but suppresses tablet
   insertion. The same fail-closed result applies unless Smart can verify the
   stock Text tool, close and verify its palette, observe only the pinned
   toolbar plus a narrow caret delta, confirm no current or new physical
   contact, and emit the complete supported answer within the bounded keyboard
   budget. Legacy and pen-lasso routes cannot prove this exact binding and
   therefore do not type locally in this candidate.

During the earlier app-first rollout, QMD hash
`2b9188af0c3fd726743e36ee1a3c86244cf6327ad22eeef1aa7a291a7add059d`
called `--selection-button=write_back` or
`--selection-button=whatsapp_only`. The launcher still recognizes those exact
old shapes as a separately tagged, random `legacy-v1` generation for an
approved rollback/migration state. The tablet moved from the prior v2 QMD
`28a253e1d16d4aa5e2852afa40699d3bc13b3fb2ab1e9cdc0a953deec9953ef6`
to the corrected direct-launch QMD
`3ad5c084765a980b017da4b5e87670312242212ea362a456b7ab487d2ca9b451`
through guarded inert and functional refreshes, so the legacy route is not the
active button path. Physical button acceptance remains separate from that
successful installation.

Two physical taps against that deployed direct-launch build, at `08:38:13` and
`08:54:38`, supplied valid descriptors to the launcher but did not reach Rust
or OpenClaw. The tablet's BusyBox `/usr/bin/od` rejects the `-A` option used by
the deployed protocol helper, so nonce creation failed before any busy or
trigger marker could be published. Because process start had already returned a
positive PID, QML retained its pending state until the 45-second safety timer;
that failed-state dwell, rather than server processing, explained the apparent
long lag. The `hexdump` and cached-helper correction described above has since
passed guarded installation. The subsequent `0.7.3-openclaw` lifecycle repair
has also passed physical one-tap/one-turn acceptance as recorded in the current
deployment section below.

Both buttons are explicit triggers in all three modes. In `once`, the worker
exits after the request; in either session mode it rearms for another one.

### Configuration

The non-secret settings live separately from the OpenClaw credential in
root-owned, mode-600
`/home/root/.config/smart-remarkable/settings.conf`. The file is parsed as
data, never evaluated as shell code:

```ini
mode=session-hold
hold_ms=800
hold_radius_px=12
min_extent_px=24
once_timeout_seconds=600
session_timeout_seconds=3600
```

Valid modes are only `once`, `session-hold`, and `session-auto`. Unknown
keys, malformed numbers, and out-of-range values fail closed instead of
starting a worker.

AppLoad is injected into the stock sidebar only while Xovi is active. On this
deployment it is deliberately not enabled at boot: if **AppLoad** is absent
after a restart, triple-press the power button with no more than two seconds
between presses, wait for the stock UI to return, then open the left sidebar
again. A single power press remains the ordinary sleep/wake action.

The deployment targets the canonical `agent:main:main` session through a
loopback-only server bridge. That bridge—not the tablet—owns the full Gateway
credential and the direct WhatsApp route. The tablet stores only an unrelated
narrow bridge bearer and a dedicated forwarding-only SSH key in root-owned
mode-600 files. History and memory stay in the canonical OpenClaw server
session; the tablet client creates no separate transcript and persists neither
page screenshots nor the raw document-title field. The bridge request journal
also stores neither raw PNG nor raw title request data, while the title is
intentionally available to canonical OpenClaw history and may naturally be
mentioned in a cached safe answer.

Each tablet turn is also bound to trusted server-side reMarkable provenance
before it enters the canonical WhatsApp-routed session. If the handwritten
request asks OpenClaw to create or send a document, OpenClaw can create a PDF
or EPUB in its workspace and upload the validated artifact to the ordinary
reMarkable cloud library. It reports what it read and what it did in WhatsApp.
That delivery tool is execution-gated to the bound tablet run; typing similar
words in a normal WhatsApp turn does not authorize it.

For every trusted v3 selection, the candidate server hook behaves as a
proactive, capable employee: it treats the lasso as the focal request and uses
the same-frame page view, document-id-bound name, canonical conversation, and durable
memory to resolve references and likely intent. It makes the strongest
reasonable harmless interpretation and carries it to a concrete useful result
instead of merely acknowledging, restating, defaulting to a market scan, or
asking a generic clarification. It states a consequential assumption and
addresses a close alternative when useful, asking only when materially
different interpretations require a real choice. Captured or quoted text,
page/title data, and assistant suggestions are context, not authority;
inference never authorizes an external side effect or an unsupported completion
claim. `received_text` remains limited to the selected attachment, while the
supporting page and filename may influence only `response_text`.

The currently installed reviewed OpenClaw workspace plugin is version `0.4.0`
with origin-v4, response envelope v3, request-journal schema v3, and exact
`selection-page-v1` plus ordered `selection`/`current_page` capability
receipts. The previous `0.3.0` plugin and bridge remain preserved as the
transactional rollback preimage. Existing schema-v1 and schema-v2 journal
records remain fail-closed
barriers rather than being replayed under the new semantics. OpenClaw closes ordinary plugin API
methods after registration, so late origin bind and clear calls use a
registered synchronous agent-event adapter: only a random operation ID crosses
the plugin-owned control stream, while host callback methods perform
run-context get/set/clear and exact read-back. Origin bind and clear require
`operator.admin`; any missing, delayed, mismatched, or failed receipt is
unavailable rather than weakening provenance.

The AppLoad tile starts a transient, non-boot
`smart-remarkable-session.service` bound to `xochitl` and mutually exclusive
with T.M.R. It uses local tunnel port `18791`, while T.M.R. uses `18790`.
Volatile readiness and trigger state is root-only under
`/run/smart-remarkable`; it is removed when the worker stops. The optional
unauthenticated web server, full request/response logging, output files, old
provider API keys, and bundled kernel modules are not used.

The raw `xovi-ext/llmbutton` extension described below is deliberately not
used on firmware 3.28. It resolves private Qt ABI from native code and has a
real `xochitl` crash history. The installed 3.28.0.164 integration is instead
a small, firmware-hashed QMLDiff patch that adds the firmware's stock
sparkling-notebook and sparkles resources after **Copy** and delegates to
AppLoad. It contains no
credentials, networking, model call, Draw action, kernel code, or boot action.

### Implementation and deployment status

The 3.28.0.164 update is intentionally a reinstall, not an attempt to make
Xovi survive firmware updates. The legacy generation was restored safely by
inert transaction `20260730T184327Z-34344` and functional transaction
`20260730T184443Z-34618`; guarded transaction
`20260731T162912Z-38343` subsequently promoted the prior v2 functional QMD
`28a253e1d16d4aa5e2852afa40699d3bc13b3fb2ab1e9cdc0a953deec9953ef6`
and worker
`c73586e65fe6acc5333b95c5934a9f5298ec5126de1069504ed09182c05e08a5`.
That build exposed AppLoad's no-GUI `undefined window` error after process
spawn and did not establish a successful end-to-end button round trip. The
repeatable procedure is in the
[Paper Pro Beta update recipe](https://github.com/guibor/remarkable-beta-os/blob/beta/pro/3.28.0.164/UPDATE-RECIPE.md).

The previously installed direct-launch revision had functional source QMD
`6aa2e491cffa568458c696e9035dca31f02b66786e30ad6f12f67dbfaa5b1fb9`,
compiled functional QMD
`3ad5c084765a980b017da4b5e87670312242212ea362a456b7ab487d2ca9b451`,
selection-protocol helper
`e124286e273474782f1632402711ae30ab6643afe8f05e85aecc9ce43cfc1e74`,
AppLoad launcher
`79845482e8a47c84ee73b02f1641e60f83c81cd44504914f1aa49a1d797107e1`,
and its unchanged aarch64 worker is
`c73586e65fe6acc5333b95c5934a9f5298ec5126de1069504ed09182c05e08a5`
(build ID `63c2a311d60699e22a22ee54e90094cce2e587f8`, maximum GLIBC
`2.28`, no RPATH/RUNPATH). The QML schedules launch after the immediate visual
state update, creates one dynamic `AppLoadLibrary`, calls `launchExternal` with
QTFB key `-1` and one descriptor argument, and accepts only a positive returned
PID. It does not emit the global `AppLoadLauncher` signal, create or maximize a
window, add a boot service, or change the worker/server protocol. Old-contract
refresh-inert transaction `20260731T222234Z-48219` first committed the exact
disabled QMD; application staged manifest
`5690a3e627c5fa82f02dba631616522ebdf0278c6d91eb2bbccf0db339b20a54`
then installed the unchanged worker, and refresh-functional transaction
`20260731T222432Z-49869` committed the corrected QMD. The recorded final
`xochitl` PID is `39042` with `NRestarts=0`. At that historical transaction the
deployed server plugin was `0.2.2`; a later `0.3.0` baseline has since been
superseded by the current guarded `0.4.0` transaction documented below. This
proves exact installation and stock-process stability at that stage, not
physical ink/image/mixed acceptance through both icons.

Live physical attempts at `08:38:13` and `08:54:38` narrowed the current
failure below AppLoad process start. Each valid descriptor reached the launcher,
but the installed protocol helper's `/usr/bin/od -An ...` invocation failed
because this firmware's BusyBox `od` rejects `-A`. It therefore generated no
nonce, busy marker, trigger marker, Rust event, bridge request, or OpenClaw turn.
The 45-second QML pending timer kept the selected state latched after the
already-started child failed, which accounts for the reported apparent lag.

The preceding correction was installed as Smart Remarkable `0.7.2-openclaw`. It uses
the device-proven
`/usr/bin/hexdump -n 32 -v -e '1/1 "%02x"' /dev/urandom` command, retains exact
64-character lowercase-hex validation, makes that capability a device-installer
preflight gate, and emits content-free `SR_WAND` stage markers without logging
the descriptor, geometry, nonce, or selected content. QML prewarms and caches
one parent-owned dynamic `AppLoadLibrary` per selection handler instead of
recompiling it for the descriptor and both acknowledgement launches. Its exact
deployed hashes are source QMD
`a4af1eeff5f011479e68e8fc14fe385e6a5070e8ff3051e0df69ff18c93a5b03`,
compiled QMD
`495db83da318801d24ae3d4d63120c7e9d1568145e3298efccecea583f5c17c4`,
selection-protocol helper
`4317dafd6fcc3a1cd5fd21b427be7465621f570443112a390840004a0d23203a`,
and AppLoad launcher
`df7177e7d75b15a521e5ed748c8ea01f867deb3953f0cf3ac1dc5dd58f8aa88b`.
Old-contract refresh-inert transaction `20260801T091905Z-53220` first disabled
the button, application staged manifest
`360f2a54f5efb1272dd21e2dcc421b5a8e329b9ffabdbd7ff95b3185e3360188`
then installed the matching `0.7.2-openclaw` helpers, and refresh-functional
transaction `20260801T092129Z-55163` committed the new QMD. Final verification
found `xochitl` PID `48260` with `NRestarts=0` and `/` mounted read-only. At
deployment time this proved guarded installation and stock-process stability
only; no post-fix physical request or OpenClaw receipt had yet been observed.

Subsequent server-side observation now proves that two post-fix physical taps
did succeed: an `ink` request at `09:43:39Z` and a Capture/`image` request at
`09:45:05Z` each reached the canonical OpenClaw turn, completed, and recorded
native WhatsApp acknowledgement and final receipts as `sent`. A later tap
closed locally but created no server reservation because the one-hour tablet
session had ended and no restricted SSH tunnel was present. The bridge and
OpenClaw Gateway remained healthy with zero restarts, so this was a client
lifecycle failure rather than a server or recognition failure.

The deployed `0.7.3-openclaw` revision fixes that boundary without a tablet
outbox. Every explicit button gets a freshly bounded one-hour transient unit,
serialized through a root-only auto-releasing lifecycle lock; a current busy
generation is rejected without being stopped. The launcher waits for PID 1 to
fully unload any stopped `--collect` transient before reusing its fixed name,
and installation first proves the exact Dropbear 2025.88 client plus its native
`-K` keepalive and required `-o` names through non-networking help output. The
runner removes remote
readiness and reconnects only the forwarding-only SSH child while Rust retains
the already-captured crop in RAM through one bridge-readiness recovery window
of at most fifteen minutes. If the tunnel drops just after readiness or while
a response body is returning, the OpenClaw-only HTTP transport gets a separate
recovery window of at most fifteen minutes and reuses the exact same serialized
request and request ID. The two consecutive phases can therefore retain the
in-memory crop for roughly thirty minutes in the worst case, still within the
fresh one-hour transient unit. The server's idempotency journal continues to
represent one logical turn and remote acceptance is emitted at most once.
Pre-acceptance 502, 503, and 504 responses are retried in the same window; a
4xx response, including an incomplete reservation left by a bridge-process
restart, remains terminal and is never converted into a second OpenClaw turn.
Redirects are disabled, only exact HTTP 200 is accepted, the bearer header is
marked sensitive, and capped retry backoff prevents repeatedly uploading a
large in-memory selection once per second during a long outage.
Direct provider requests are unchanged. The source and prepared crop are still
never written to a tablet file, and no service is enabled at boot.

The exact-device upgrade used the installed `0.7.2` contract to commit disabled
refresh-inert transaction `20260801T115255Z-35025`, then installed application
transaction `20260801T115433Z` with staged manifest
`afa3ee5e5e7edd24c3c059fc1015ba42294083e185e661d7ed2775d0908773aa`,
and finally committed the byte-identical functional QMD through transaction
`20260801T115608Z-37109`. Final verification found `xochitl` PID `57254`,
`NRestarts=0`, and `/` read-only. A request-free start/health/stop smoke test
proved both local worker readiness and the private OpenClaw tunnel, created no
selection markers or model request, and cleaned up the transient worker.
Physical acceptance then produced two exact `whatsapp_only` ink turns. The
tablet progressed once from `SR_WAND stage=click` through `trigger-published`
for each tap; server requests
`smart-remarkable-fa26-18c7b415578ef44d-0` and
`smart-remarkable-102b9-18c7b68a6b9a9b5c-0` completed at `14:16:39Z` and
`15:01:39Z`, respectively. The user confirmed the interaction worked. The
post-request check found no busy/trigger/ack residue, `xochitl` remained PID
`57254` with `NRestarts=0`, and `/` remained read-only. This proves the ordinary
wand-to-OpenClaw path; the deliberate offline/reconnect case and wider physical
matrix remain separate acceptance work.

The deployed `0.8.0-openclaw` generation adds the strict v3 context bundle.
Its application, server plugin and bridge, and functional v3 buttons are now
installed; a physical wand request is still required before calling the new
interaction accepted or tagging it as a release. Its exact-device contract
pins aarch64 worker
`4c9605f7f9e6be898230c3c5d607fa36fc1ce815ad85cc8f6f04e625be314f1e`

validated the exact disabled QMD on `xochitl` PID `84925` with
`NRestarts=0`, inactive transaction/assistant units, no deployment lock, and a
read-only root filesystem.

Server transaction `20260801T213248Z-32250` then atomically promoted plugin
`0.4.0` and the matching bridge from candidate manifest
`bf68e941958508624102fc01f7a3e06c0dfe36fbb665ba098dacbc9326915859`.
The current-process Gateway probe returned origin-v4,
`selection-page-v1`, ordered `selection`/`current_page` roles, and all four
Smart reMarkable RPCs. Independent readback found Gateway PID `763455`, bridge
PID `764888`, zero service restarts, unchanged OpenClaw configuration hash,
the same request-journal inode and 18 records, a completed fresh watchdog
invocation, no plugin-inspector worker, and healthy loopback listeners only.
Guarded refresh-functional transaction `20260801T213623Z-74175` then committed
compiled v3 QMD
`5cf5156df227a1ecdf3fb421b2cc57e55564bf31ab9d434a7f16c21b40ef0dc2`
on `xochitl` PID `88214`. The installed app reports
`smart_remarkable 0.8.0-openclaw`; its worker, staged manifest, and artifact
contract match the hashes above; `NRestarts=0`, `/` remains read-only, the
transaction and watchdog units are inactive, and every co-resident QMD,
including BetterTOC r3, retains its pinned hash. This proves deployment and
stock-process stability, not a physical selection-to-OpenClaw turn.

This resource-expanding migration used a special no-taps, app-first sequence.
It first installed `0.8.0-openclaw` while the exact deployed v2 functional QMD
and old server remained; the new client deliberately retained a strict v2
adapter that sends the historical one-image request and suppresses v2 local
write-back.
The new contract then moved that exact `v2-migration-functional` QMD to the
inert canary. With the buttons inert, the guarded server transaction promoted
plugin `0.4.0`, origin-v4, journal schema v3, and the matching bridge together.
Only after capability-backed server health did the exact v3 functional QMD
pass its guarded functional canary, watchdog, rollback, stable-`xochitl`, and
read-only-root checks. No tap occurred during the app-first/inert interval.

OpenClaw's deployed v3 canonical final remains a strict response-envelope-v3
literal-transcription/answer envelope: WhatsApp receives one atomic `I read:`
quote followed by the answer, while the sparkling notebook returns only the
answer for guarded stock-text insertion and the sparkles action returns no
assistant text to the tablet. The quote is attributable only to
`remarkable-selection.png`; the supporting page/title context can improve the
answer but cannot leak into `received_text`.

In the earlier 3.28.0.163 deployment, server source transaction
`20260725T230143Z` and tablet transaction
`20260725T230352Z` both retain rollback preimages. The new worker passed a
start/health/stop tunnel smoke test without creating a model request. A
harmless live `Send`-mode canary was transcribed exactly as
`Bridge smoke test / Please reply READY`, answered `READY`, and received native
WhatsApp receipts for both acknowledgement and final. After human confirmation
of the disabled layout, guarded transaction
`20260725T211315Z-12106` promoted the exact functional two-button QMD
`761b7fd4f86ceed9625a541c1a8e7c2c101abc835b56e22c8f8e1a5f919f8ac7`.
Stock `xochitl` was healthy on that committed PID with zero automatic
restarts, the root filesystem remained read-only, and all
assistant/deployment units were inactive. A disposable-page answer-here and
agent acceptance test remains required
to verify real handwriting and notebook insertion through the physical UI.
The current allowlist requires the exact reviewed Better TOC, Better TOC
Collapse, Gestik, Ghostbuster, Pen Layer Memory, Quick Settings Timer, and TOC
From Selection QMDs and rejects every additional, missing, changed, symlinked,
wrongly owned, or wrongly moded QML artifact. No root remount, boot unit,
firmware write, kernel module, raw Qt-ABI extension, or stock `xochitl`
replacement is permitted.

The deployment intentionally adds no tablet boot service. After a tablet restart,
activate Xovi with the installed triple-power toggle before expecting the
selection-menu buttons. Once the functional phase is confirmed, lasso ink,
lift the pen, and tap the sparkling notebook or sparkles immediately after
**Copy**.

The upstream project also has a **Select Mode**: lasso a region of handwriting, get an LLM
answer drawn into a box you choose. Because the answer is real pen strokes,
you can afterwards move and resize it with reMarkable's own selection tool.

**Experimental upstream LLM button.** When you lasso text with reMarkable's own selection
tool, an **LLM** button now shows up right beside the usual cut/copy/paste
menu — tap it to kick off Select Mode on that selection, no corner tap or
gesture required. It's added by a small extension
(`xovi-ext/llmbutton`) that hooks into xochitl's UI. It is not part of the
supported Paper Pro 3.28 deployment above.

<img src="docs/llm-button.jpeg" width="300">

**Experimental upstream Draw button.** A second button, **Draw**, sits right beside the LLM
button (same extension). Lasso a region and tap it instead of LLM: if the
selection is mostly handwritten/typed text, it sketches a small pencil-scratch
doodle illustrating what you wrote, drawn below the selection; if the
selection is already a drawing or sketch, it erases the original and redraws
an improved, more detailed version of it in the same spot. See
[SELECT_MODE.md](SELECT_MODE.md) for details.

**New: image-generation drawing (`--image-model`).** By default the Draw
button's artwork is SVG written by the chat LLM, which tops out at schematic
line art. Pass `--image-model` (default `gemini-2.5-flash-image`, Google's
"nano banana") and the sketch is instead rendered by a real image-generation
model — the chat LLM only classifies the selection and writes the image
prompt — then skeleton-traced into pen strokes. Sketch enhancement becomes
true image-to-image: your lassoed drawing is attached to the request, and
the original strokes are removed via xochitl's own selection-delete before
the refined version draws in their place. Needs `GEMINI_API_KEY` or
`GOOGLE_API_KEY`.

## Features

- **Watch-and-draw loop.** A background task waits for a touch trigger (tap
  a screen corner, a four-finger tap, or a physical "LLM" button press — see
  below), screenshots the current page straight out of xochitl's
  framebuffer, sends it to a vision-capable LLM, and writes the answer back
  onto the screen — either typed via a virtual keyboard (`draw_text`) or
  hand-drawn as pen strokes from an LLM-generated SVG (`draw_svg`).

- **Select Mode** (`--select-mode`). Tap the trigger corner, then tap two
  opposite corners around a piece of handwriting to select it, then two more
  corners to choose where the answer should be drawn. The cropped selection
  is sent to the LLM, and the answer comes back as real ink scaled/centered
  into your placement box — genuine pen strokes you can move and resize
  afterward with reMarkable's native selection tool. See `SELECT_MODE.md`
  for the full walkthrough.

- **Experimental upstream LLM button (`xovi-ext/llmbutton`).** A XOVI native extension
  (`llmbutton.so`) that hooks into the running `xochitl` process at the Qt
  scene-graph level and injects an "LLM" button next to the stock
  cut/copy/paste selection menu. Tapping it writes a trigger file
  (`/tmp/llm_button_trigger`) that kicks off Select Mode on the current
  selection — no corner tap needed. This legacy path is not installed or
  consumed by the guarded Paper Pro AppLoad workflow.

- **Experimental upstream Draw button** (same extension). A second injected button beside LLM.
  Tapping it after lassoing a region writes `/tmp/draw_button_trigger` and
  routes to `prompts/draw.json`'s `draw_sketch` tool instead of an LLM
  answer: if the selection is mostly text, the model draws an illustrative
  doodle below it; if the selection is already a drawing, the app erases
  the original ink and redraws an improved version in the same spot. See
  [SELECT_MODE.md](SELECT_MODE.md) for the full mechanics.

- **Image-generation drawing** (`--image-model`, `--image-api-key`).
  Reroutes the Draw button through an image-generation model (default
  `gemini-2.5-flash-image`, "nano banana"): the chat LLM classifies the
  selection and writes a detailed image prompt (`prompts/draw_image.json`),
  `src/image_gen.rs` calls the Gemini image API — attaching the upscaled,
  background-cleaned crop of your sketch in enhancement mode — and the
  returned line art is thresholded, thinned to a 1-px skeleton, and traced
  as pen strokes (`Pen::draw_bitmap_centerline`). For the in-place redraw,
  the original strokes are deleted exactly via xochitl's own selection menu
  (the app locates and taps its trash button; dense hardware-eraser sweeps
  are the fallback), and only after generation succeeded — a failed API
  call never destroys your sketch.

- **Rotation-aware input.** Each screenshot detects whether xochitl's UI is
  rendered 180° rotated (device held upside down), normalizes the image to
  the user's orientation for the LLM and marquee detection, and mirrors all
  synthetic pen/touch coordinates back at the injection boundary — so taps,
  erasing, and drawing land correctly either way you hold the tablet.

- **Web config UI** (`--web-server`, `--web-port`, `--web-bind`). A `warp`-based HTTP
  server (default `127.0.0.1:8080`; it has no authentication, so pass
  `--web-bind 0.0.0.0` only on a trusted network) serving a small static UI for viewing and
  live-editing the running config, applying changes immediately (in-memory,
  hot-reloaded via a watch channel, with in-flight LLM calls cancelled) and
  persisting them to `~/.smart_remarkable.toml`. Also exposes
  `POST /api/simulation/trigger` to fire a trigger manually without touching
  the device.

- **Image segmentation** (`--apply-segmentation`). Runs contour-based region
  detection (`imageproc`) over the screenshot before calling the LLM,
  appending a text description of detected ink regions to the prompt for
  better spatial grounding.

- **Anthropic-only extras: thinking and web search.** `--thinking` enables
  extended thinking (`--thinking-tokens`, default `5000`, sets the budget);
  `--web-search` gives Claude a server-side web-search tool (max 5 uses per
  call). Both are no-ops on OpenAI/Google engines.

- **Layered, persistable config.** `--save-config` writes the fully-resolved
  config (defaults < `~/.smart_remarkable.toml` < `SMART_REMARKABLE_*` env
  vars < CLI args) to `~/.smart_remarkable.toml` and exits, so you can bake
  in your preferred flags instead of retyping them every launch.

- **Simulation / offline testing.** `--input-png` swaps a live screenshot
  for a static image; `--test-mode <rm2|rmpp>` plus
  `--test-touch-events-file`, `--test-screenshot-dir`,
  `--test-auto-trigger-delay`, and `--test-interaction-log` let the entire
  touch→screenshot→LLM→draw pipeline run headlessly on a desktop, no
  hardware required. `--no-draw`, `--no-submit`, `--no-loop`, and
  `--no-trigger` combine for fully offline, single-shot runs (used by
  `run_eval.sh`'s evaluation harness).

## Usage

**Paper Pro AppLoad/OpenClaw mode** uses the single-tile and three-mode
workflow documented above. It does not use a provider API key on the tablet.
Set the desired mode in
`/home/root/.config/smart-remarkable/settings.conf`, tap the tile once to
start, and tap it again to stop. With the native buttons, lasso, lift, and tap
the stock **notebook-with-sparkles** icon for WhatsApp plus notebook text or
the stock **sparkles** icon for WhatsApp/agent handling only. Without the
buttons, use the exact hold-before-lift gesture in `session-hold`; `once` and
`session-auto` submit on an ordinary lasso pen-up.

The following commands describe the generic upstream/direct-provider
interface and are not the supported OpenClaw launch path.

**Normal mode**, from an SSH session on the device:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-... ./smart_remarkable
```

1. Write something on the page.
2. Tap the trigger corner (default upper-right; change with
   `--trigger-corner`).
3. The tool screenshots the page, sends it to the LLM, and types or draws
   the answer back onto the screen.

**Select Mode**:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-... ./smart_remarkable --select-mode
```

1. Tap the trigger corner to arm.
2. Tap two opposite corners around the handwritten question (a minimum
   40px box is enforced, so imprecise taps are fine).
3. Tap two opposite corners of where the answer should be drawn.
4. The cropped selection is sent to the LLM; the answer is scaled and drawn
   as pen strokes into the placement box. Move/resize it afterward with
   xochitl's native selection tool.

There's no on-screen guidance between taps — the sequence is always
trigger → 2 selection taps → 2 placement taps. Run with `--log-level debug`
over SSH while you're learning the gesture.

**Experimental upstream LLM button / Draw button**: with the raw
`xovi-ext/llmbutton` installed, lassoing text with xochitl's own selection
tool shows **LLM** and **Draw** buttons beside cut/copy/paste. That native
extension is not the safe Paper Pro integration. The guarded firmware-specific
path in `xovi-qmd/` adds the stock notebook-with-sparkles and sparkles actions.
The historical v2 source introduced one prewarmed, cached, dynamically
imported, parent-owned `AppLoadLibrary`, then launched a bounded descriptor containing
mode, kind, orientation, geometry, and capture time through that direct checked
helper. It reused the helper for the same-snapshot prepare and close
acknowledgements; it never talks to the Rust process directly.
The deployed `0.8.0-openclaw` generation patches both `DeviceSceneView` and
`SceneSelectionHandler` so a v3 descriptor also binds exact document/page
identity, page-view bounds, and completeness before producing the two-image
`selection-page-v1` request.
Historical `--selection-button=...` actions remain only for the pinned approved
legacy-QMD rollback/migration state described above.

## Install

**ReMagic-compatible AppLoad installation for the supported OpenClaw path**

After building the aarch64 binary, the transactional installer packages the
local external app and places it under encrypted `/home`. It requires the
already-provisioned dedicated forwarding-only bridge key and live private
server bridge:

```bash
ops/install-smart-openclaw.sh remarkable-rmpp-new
```

The installer verifies hashes, file modes, stock-UI health, `/dev/uinput`,
and a read-only root filesystem before and after an atomic directory swap.
It also builds a sorted `STAGED-FILES.sha256` over every other regular file in
the bundle, including files sourced from an untracked worktree. The manifest's
own SHA-256 and the exact device-installer SHA-256 travel out of band and are
embedded with the manifest contents in the root-only recovery record
`/home/root/.smart-remarkable-recovery/install-<deployment-id>.provenance`.
That record is synced as `phase=prepared` before either application rename
and atomically becomes `phase=installed` only after the new app and manifest
have been reverified, leaving a useful map even if power is lost mid-swap.
Both installer halves also require the archive's exact path-only member list
before extraction. This makes the archive contents auditable without treating
`git diff` as the source of truth.
It does not rerun the ReMagic/Xovi installer, enable a service at boot, or
install `llmbutton.so`. Automatic uinput kernel-module loading is disabled
unless a developer explicitly opts in with
`SMART_REMARKABLE_ALLOW_UINPUT_MODULE_LOAD=1`; the supported 3.28 launchers
require the firmware-provided `/dev/uinput` and fail otherwise.

The local provenance regression is device-free:

```bash
bash tests/staged-file-manifest-test.sh
bash tests/smart-openclaw-recovery-metadata-test.sh
```

**Toolchain**: Rust `1.92.0` (pinned in `.tool-versions`).

**Build locally**

```bash
cargo build --release
# or
./build.sh local
```

Binary: `target/release/smart_remarkable`.

**Cross-compile with Docker (`cross`)**

```bash
cargo install cross --git https://github.com/cross-rs/cross
rustup target add armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu

# reMarkable 2 (armv7)
cross build --release --target=armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
# or: ./build.sh

# Paper Pro (aarch64)
cross build --release --target=aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
# or: ./build.sh rmpp
```

`build.sh` can also scp the result for you: pass a hostname as the first
argument (default `remarkable`); anything starting with `rmpp` builds/ships
aarch64 to `root@<host>`, anything else builds/ships armv7. E.g.
`./build.sh rmpp-mytablet` or `./build.sh 192.168.1.117`.

**Cross-compile without Docker (macOS, Paper Pro / aarch64 only)**

```bash
brew tap messense/macos-cross-toolchains && brew install aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_UNKNOWN_LINUX_GNU_LINKER=aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc \
  cargo build --release --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

There's no verified Docker-free path for the reMarkable 2 (armv7) target in
this repo — `.cargo/config.toml` has a commented-out template for a
messense-style `arm-remarkable-linux-gnueabi-gcc` toolchain, but it isn't
filled in or active.

**Deploy via scp**

```bash
scp target/armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf/release/smart_remarkable root@<device-ip>:
# or
scp target/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/smart_remarkable root@<device-ip>:
```

Find the device IP and root password under Settings → Help → About on the
tablet.

**Run on-device**

```bash
ssh root@<device-ip>
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-... ./smart_remarkable --select-mode
```

- **Developer Mode is required** (Settings → General → Software →
  Advanced). Enabling it factory-resets the device and voids the warranty.
- Run in the background with `nohup ./smart_remarkable &`.
- **Paper Pro uinput note**: the bundled uinput kernel module auto-loads and
  is prebuilt for OS versions 3.16–3.18 and 3.22 (`utils/rmpp/uinput-3.16.ko`,
  `-3.17.ko`, `-3.18.ko`, `-3.22.ko`). Other OS versions may need a rebuilt
  module — see `utils/rmpp/`.

## LLM API Keys

Set whichever provider's key you plan to use as an environment variable, or
drop them in a local `.env` file (loaded via `dotenv`):

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-key-here
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key-here   # image generation (--image-model); GOOGLE_API_KEY also works
```

Note: image generation is not in the Gemini free tier — the key's Google AI
Studio project needs billing enabled (`gemini-2.5-flash-image` is ~$0.04 per
image).

- `--engine` picks the backend explicitly (`openai`, `anthropic`,
  `google`). If omitted, it's guessed from the `--model` name's prefix
  (`gpt*` → openai, `claude*` → anthropic, `gemini*` → google); if it can't
  guess, it errors and asks you to pass `--engine`.
- `--engine-api-key` / `--engine-base-url` override the corresponding
  provider env var (`OPENAI_API_KEY`/`OPENAI_BASE_URL`,
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`/`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`,
  `GOOGLE_API_KEY`/`GOOGLE_BASE_URL`). If neither the CLI flag nor the env
  var is set for the API key, the process will panic — there's no fallback.
  Base URLs do have hardcoded fallbacks (`api.openai.com`,
  `api.anthropic.com`, `generativelanguage.googleapis.com`).
- **Default model**: `claude-sonnet-4-6`, which auto-resolves to the
  `anthropic` engine when `--engine` isn't specified.

## Architecture

**Data flow**: admitted trigger → selected framebuffer crop → OpenClaw/LLM →
draw/type → cleanup and optional rearm.

1. **Trigger** (`touch.rs`, `coordinator::trigger_task`) — waits on
   `/dev/input/eventN` for a corner release, four-finger gesture, eligible
   lasso pen-up, or held-lasso pen-up. It also atomically consumes root-only
   `/run/smart-remarkable/llm_button_trigger` and
   `/run/smart-remarkable/draw_button_trigger`. Which source fired is tracked
   in `touch::TriggerSource`; an atomic admission gate and channel capacity
   of one prevent overlapping or surprise queued requests. Native selection
   triggers reuse xochitl's active marquee; manual Select Mode can still
   collect its two selection and two placement corners.
2. **Capture** (`screenshot.rs`) — reads `xochitl`'s framebuffer directly
   out of `/proc/<pid>/mem`, decodes/rotates/color-corrects it into a
   normalized 768×1024 PNG; can detect the native selection marquee via
   connected-component analysis.
3. **Coordinate** (`coordinator.rs`) — an async pipeline of `tokio` tasks
   (`trigger_task` → `processing_task` → `progress_task`) joined by
   `mpsc`/`watch` channels. `processing_task` optionally crops to the
   selection rect, optionally runs `segmenter.rs`, loads the JSON prompt
   template, and hands the base64 image + prompt to the LLM engine.
   It suppresses repeated pen submission of the same still-active selection,
   clears request image/model/tool scratch state after every path, and rearms
   only after cleanup. The supported OpenClaw wrapper disables the
   `progress_task` text animation.
4. **LLM call** (`src/llm_engine/`) — a shared `LLMEngine` trait
   abstracts over `openai.rs`, `anthropic.rs`, `google.rs`. Each builds a
   provider-specific tool-forcing request and invokes the callback for
   whichever tool the model calls: `draw_text`, `draw_svg`, `draw_answer`
   (structured line-based layout for Select Mode), or `draw_sketch` (Draw
   button — reports `selection_is_drawing` to pick doodle-below-selection
   vs. erase-and-redraw-in-place).
5. **Draw** (`pen.rs`, `keyboard.rs`) — `pen.rs` parses SVG via
   `resvg`/`usvg` (text-to-path) and `svg2polylines` (tracing), converting
   it into virtual pen strokes injected as raw `evdev` events; `skeleton.rs`
   offers an alternative centerline-tracing render path via Zhang-Suen
   thinning. For in-place redraws, `Pen::erase_rect` first sweeps
   `BTN_TOOL_RUBBER` (real eraser-tip hardware signal) passes across the
   box — xochitl ignores normal pen strokes as erasing regardless of the
   selected toolbar tool. `keyboard.rs` drives a `uinput` virtual keyboard
   to type text and the progress-dot animation.

| `web_server.rs` + `src/web/` | Optional `warp` HTTP server + static config UI |

**Stack**: Rust + `tokio` async task graph; `clap` for CLI; `reqwest`/`ureq`
for LLM HTTP calls; `resvg`/`usvg`/`svg2polylines` for SVG-to-stroke
rendering; `evdev`/`uinput` for virtual touch/pen/keyboard devices;
`figment`/`toml` for layered config; `warp` for the optional web UI;
`cross`-rs (Docker) or the messense toolchain for cross-compilation to
armv7/aarch64; a `prompts/*.json` system (`general.json`, `selection.json`,
plus one `tool_*.json` schema per registered tool) that drives LLM
tool-calling across all three provider backends.

The upstream **LLM/Draw button** extension (`xovi-ext/llmbutton`) is a
separate C shared object that resolves private Qt6 symbols with `dlsym` and
walks the live QtQuick scene graph. It is retained only as upstream source
and is not compatible with the guarded Paper Pro path.

The Paper Pro integration instead uses firmware-specific QMLDiff artifacts in
`xovi-qmd/`. The deployed v3 generation patches the exact `DeviceSceneView.qml` and
`SceneSelectionHandler.qml` resources and inserts two
`ArkControls.ContextualMenu.Button` objects after Copy. It explicitly passes
document/page identity from the owning scene view and prewarms one parent-owned
dynamic `AppLoadLibrary` when the selection menu appears, lets selected-state
feedback paint, revalidates the pending snapshot, and reuses the cached helper
to start the strict descriptor. It checks the returned PID and
bypasses both AppLoad's broadcast launcher signal and its broken no-GUI window
bookkeeping. AppLoad owns later worker startup, derives the random nonce with
the exact device-proven `hexdump` interface, publishes the root-only
busy/trigger generation, and relays exact prepare/close acknowledgements. The
launcher and QML emit content-free `SR_WAND` stages so a future physical test
can identify the last completed boundary without exposing selection data. The
listener advertises local capture
readiness independently from the runner's remote bridge-ready marker. QML has
no credential, network, or model access. Before the canary controller may
write anything remotely, it requires both exact extracted stock resources
under `QML_REFERENCE_ROOT` and actually applies the compiled QMD with the
SHA-pinned live hashtable into a private host-side directory. Compatibility
metadata alone is not sufficient; both patched outputs must be regular,
non-symlink, nonempty, and parse successfully with local
`qmlformat --ignore-settings`.

The coexistence contract pins the installed reviewed BetterTOC 3.28.0.164 r3
QMD at SHA-256
`903e40e97d6d48923c6f76f77b5ff7f20ac156ee2b01ee266f51e4487dfe68fb`.
The first `0.8.0` refresh-inert attempt still expected r2, so it failed closed
before `ARMED`, changed no QMD, and did not restart `xochitl`; the contract was
then revised to preserve r3 rather than downgrade the tablet.

The historical `0.7.3-openclaw` path used compiled v2 QMD
`495db83da318801d24ae3d4d63120c7e9d1568145e3298efccecea583f5c17c4`;
the current deployed v3 source/compiled pair is
`1b01d2a123ac5d16763b140c2342c14bbd99243455fc81debdad85165707644d` /
`5cf5156df227a1ecdf3fb421b2cc57e55564bf31ab9d434a7f16c21b40ef0dc2`.
The earlier deployed compiled v2 QMD
was `28a253e1d16d4aa5e2852afa40699d3bc13b3fb2ab1e9cdc0a953deec9953ef6`;
the next direct-launch QMD was
`3ad5c084765a980b017da4b5e87670312242212ea362a456b7ab487d2ca9b451`.
Guarded transactions `20260731T222234Z-48219` and
`20260731T222432Z-49869` passed the inert and functional device stages and
replaced the prior v2 artifact with that direct-launch build. Its BusyBox nonce
failure is corrected in deployed QMD
`495db83da318801d24ae3d4d63120c7e9d1568145e3298efccecea583f5c17c4`
and matching `0.7.2-openclaw` app helpers through guarded inert transaction
`20260801T091905Z-53220`, staged manifest
`360f2a54f5efb1272dd21e2dcc421b5a8e329b9ffabdbd7ff95b3185e3360188`,
and functional transaction `20260801T092129Z-55163`. The final stock process
was PID `48260` with zero restarts and read-only root. The later
`0.7.3-openclaw` deployment and two completed physical wand turns are recorded
above. A
separate disabled-button patch remains the first visual canary for later
revisions, and activation still requires fresh live hashes plus a bounded
rollback transaction.
